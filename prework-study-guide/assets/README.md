## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was that I wanted to learn atleast the basics of coding before the class started.
- I built this project because it will help me in the future when I need to build websites and use javascript, html, and css.
- This project solved the problem I had of not knowing how to do anything coding related besides some basics in Python.
- I learned the basics of javascript, html, and css. Things such as loops and what headers/footers are.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used in the future to help me refresh my memory on some of the basics. Also, each section contains varying code, with none of it being all that similar in my eyes. This shows that I learned a wide variety of things doing the Prework and that I can use it for future projects by looking back at my past code.
